# Cursor Note Search GUI - Portability Guide

## ✅ **Ready for Any Computer!**

Your note search GUI has been made fully portable and can now run on any Windows computer with minimal setup.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed for Portability**

### **Before (Issues):**
- ❌ Hardcoded username: `C:\Users\jackw\AppData\...`
- ❌ Fixed conda environment name
- ❌ Manual dependency installation required
- ❌ Complex setup process

### **After (Portable):**
- ✅ **Dynamic user detection** - Works for any Windows user
- ✅ **Flexible environment handling** - Creates or finds suitable conda environment
- ✅ **Auto-dependency installation** - Sets up everything automatically
- ✅ **One-click setup** - `setup_for_new_computer.bat`

**Note:** The data files (`cursor_notes_found.txt`, `your_cursor_notes.txt`) contain YOUR specific notes and should not be shared. Each user will generate their own when they run the app.

## 🚀 **Setup Instructions for Recipients**

### **Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
1. Copy the project folder to their computer
2. Double-click: setup_for_new_computer.bat
3. Wait for setup to complete (installs conda, environment, dependencies)
4. Application launches automatically
```

### **Method 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
1. Install Miniconda from: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
2. Copy project folder
3. Double-click: start_note_search.bat
4. It will create environment and install dependencies automatically
```

### **Method 3: Expert Users**
```bash
conda create -n cursor-notepad-browser python=3.10 -y
conda activate cursor-notepad-browser  
pip install reportlab python-docx
python note_search_gui.py
```

## 🔍 **How Auto-Detection Works**

### **User Path Detection:**
```python
# OLD (hardcoded):
path = r"C:\Users\jackw\AppData\Roaming\Cursor\..."

# NEW (dynamic):
user_home = Path.home()  # Gets current user automatically
path = user_home / "AppData" / "Roaming" / "Cursor" / "User" / "workspaceStorage"
```

### **Environment Detection:**
The startup script tries multiple environment names:
1. `cursor-notepad-browser` (preferred)
2. `cursor-notes` (alternative)
3. `cursor` (alternative)
4. Creates new one if none exist

## 📋 **System Requirements**

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Windows 10/11
- 4GB RAM  
- 1GB free disk space
- Internet connection (for initial conda/dependency download)

**Automatically Installed:**
- Python 3.10 (via conda)
- tkinter (GUI framework)
- sqlite3 (database access)  
- reportlab (PDF export)
- python-docx (Word export)

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior on New Computer**

### **First Run:**
1. User double-clicks `setup_for_new_computer.bat`
2. Script detects if conda is installed
3. If not, provides download instructions
4. Creates conda environment with Python 3.10
5. Installs optional dependencies (PDF/DOCX support)
6. Launches application
7. App automatically scans user's Cursor workspace
8. Shows found notes in searchable interface

### **Subsequent Runs:**
1. User double-clicks `start_note_search.bat`
2. Script finds existing environment
3. Launches application immediately
4. Auto-scans for any new notes

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting for Recipients**

### **"Conda not found" Error:**
- Install Miniconda from: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
- Restart command prompt after installation

### **"No notes found" Message:**
- Cursor must be installed and used before (has workspace data)
- Cursor stores data in: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\`
- If path doesn't exist, user hasn't used Cursor yet

### **"Environment creation failed":**
- Check internet connection (conda needs to download packages)
- Run as administrator if permission issues
- Make sure disk has at least 1GB free space

## 📊 **Cross-Computer Compatibility**

### **✅ Works On:**
- Any Windows 10/11 computer
- Any Windows username/account
- Computers with or without existing conda
- Fresh installs or existing development setups

### **⚠️ Limitations:**
- Windows only (uses Windows-specific paths)
- Requires Cursor editor to be installed (for data to extract)
- Needs internet for initial dependency download

## 🎉 **Distribution Checklist**
