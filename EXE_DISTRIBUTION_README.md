# Cursor Note Search - Standalone Executable

## 🚀 **Super Easy Setup - Just Download and Run!**

This is a standalone executable version of the Cursor Note Search GUI. **No Python, conda, or dependencies needed!**

## 📥 **Quick Start**

### **For End Users (Non-Technical):**
1. **Download** `CursorNoteSearch.exe` (16MB)
2. **Double-click** `CursorNoteSearch.exe`
3. **That's it!** - The application will automatically:
   - Find your Cursor workspace databases
   - Extract and display your notes
   - Provide search and export functionality

## ✅ **What This Executable Includes**

**Everything bundled in one file:**
- ✅ Python 3.10 runtime
- ✅ tkinter GUI framework
- ✅ SQLite database support
- ✅ PDF export capability (reportlab)
- ✅ Word document export (python-docx)
- ✅ All custom modules (database scanner, note parser)
- ✅ Documentation files

**No installation required!**

## 🎯 **System Requirements**

**Minimum:**
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- 4GB RAM
- 50MB free disk space
- Cursor editor installed (with some workspace usage)

**That's it!** No Python, conda, or development tools needed.

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **Auto-Detection**: Finds your Cursor workspace at `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\`
2. **Scanning**: Automatically scans all workspace databases for notepad content
3. **Parsing**: Separates individual notes from notepad files
4. **Search**: Provides real-time search through all your notes
5. **Export**: Allows copying and exporting notes in multiple formats

## 🎮 **Usage Guide**

### **First Run:**
1. Double-click `CursorNoteSearch.exe`
2. Wait for auto-scan: "Auto-scan complete: Found X notes"
3. Type `notepad` in search box to filter actual notepad content
4. Browse and export your notes

### **Finding Specific Content:**
- `notepad` → Your actual notepad entries
- `macro` → Automation project notes  
- `RAG` → AI system specifications
- `ghost` → Desktop widget projects
- `download` → File sharing tool ideas

### **Exporting Notes:**
- **Copy** → Copy note content to clipboard
- **Export** → Save individual note as TXT/PDF/DOCX/Markdown
- **Export All Filtered** → Save all search results to file

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **"No notes found" Message:**
- Make sure Cursor is installed and you've used it before
- Check that you have workspace data in: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage\`
- Try creating a note in Cursor, then re-run the application

### **Application Won't Start:**
- Run as administrator if you get permission errors
- Make sure Windows Defender isn't blocking the executable
- Try extracting to a different folder if antivirus interferes

### **Slow Performance:**
- First scan takes 1-2 minutes (processing all workspace databases)
- Subsequent searches are instant
- Large workspace collections may take longer to process

## 📊 **File Size & Performance**

**Executable Details:**
- **Size**: ~16MB (includes entire Python runtime + dependencies)
- **Startup**: 2-5 seconds on modern systems
- **Memory**: ~50-100MB during operation
- **Scan Time**: 1-2 minutes for full workspace scan

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy**

**Data Safety:**
- ✅ **No internet required** - works completely offline
- ✅ **No data uploaded** - everything stays on your computer
- ✅ **Read-only access** - only reads from Cursor databases, doesn't modify them
- ✅ **Local processing** - all scanning and parsing happens locally

**Antivirus Notes:**
- Some antivirus software may flag PyInstaller executables as suspicious
- This is a false positive due to the way Python executables are packaged
- The source code is available for review if needed

## 🎁 **Distribution**

**For Sharing:**
- Share just the `CursorNoteSearch.exe` file (16MB)
- No additional files or setup required
- Works on any Windows 10/11 computer with Cursor installed

- Source code available for review and modification
- Can be rebuilt with PyInstaller if needed
- Spec file included for customization

## 🆚 **Comparison: Python vs Executable**

| Feature | Python Version | Executable Version |
